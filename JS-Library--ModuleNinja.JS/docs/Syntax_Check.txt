 Syntax Check

 This function contains all the syntax rules about the variable and function names
 that can be used in the modules or in the classes.
 It throws an exception if the given name doesn't match the rules, or returns void if it does.

 The rules are simple:
       - the name must be of string type
       - name's lenght must be bigger than 0
       - name must start with a latin letter
       - name can only contain latin letters and numbers
